# Bangla Stemmer

In this project, we are creating the largest annotated dataset for Bangla stemming, using which we will be able to implement the first neural network based stemmer for Bangla Language. For that, we have created two websites : one for the annotation or data collection purpose, where a user (with a admin issued username and password) can login and annotate; another website was built for automatically identifying the stems of any given Bangla using deep neural networks, which were trained using the annotated dataset of 60K.
