# Bangla Stemmer

In this project, we are creating the largest annotated dataset for Bangla stemming, using which we will be able to implement the first neural network based stemmer for Bangla Language. For that, we have created two websites : one for the annotation or data collection purpose, where a user (with a admin issued username and password) can login and annotate; another website was built for automatically identifying the stems of any given Bangla using deep neural networks, which were trained using the annotated dataset of 60K. In the stemmig website, you can use either bangla sentence or a single word as a input. <br>

Using the annotation website one can annotate as many words as he/she may want (while following the rules of the stemming). While annotating, if someone finds a word that is confusing, for which he/she doesn't
know the correct stem, he/she can skip that word. There is also a garbage option for words no meaning. A user can check his stats, such as, no. of words annotated by him/her and also edit previously annotated 
data by him/her.

Username           : mahir_05 <br>
Password           : 12345678 <br>
*The website may take 4-5 minutes to load and we are extremely sorry for that. We are trying to fix this issue.

## Brief Overview : 

### Log-in Page : 

A user must need to log-in with the admin issued username and password.

### Data Annotation Page : 
</br>
A user can annotate a given word by using back-space and submit the stem of the given word. One can skip the words that he/she may find confusion and the meaningless words should go to garbage.

</br>
In this page, a user can view the number of words he/she annotated and can also view the list of words that he/she annotated and edit them, if necessary.
