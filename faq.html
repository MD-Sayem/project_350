                This website is built by sust cse 2018. Basically, this website
                is a part of an academic project/research work. This website
                will be used for collecting data, that will be used for the
                future research. And FYI, the research is about root/stem
                identification in bangla langugage.

                Unfortunately, you can't sign up on your own. Usually, the admin
                assigns the selected users and only then you can get your
                username and password, which is required for signing in.

              <p>
                First, you'll have to log in using the assigned username and
                password. After that, you can access the data-entry page. In
                this page, you'll be given a word and you have to identify the
                root/stem of the word using the backspace key on your keyboard.
                Here you'll find three buttons : submit, skip and garbage. After
                you find the root, using backspace, press enter. The indentified
                root will be recorded on our database. If you are not sure about
                the root of a word, skip that word by pressing the skip button.
                If you think the given word is not a valid word, press the
                garbage button. Please make sure to log out before you exit the
                website.
